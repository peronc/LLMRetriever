# Large Language Model Retriever
In this repository, we have provided the code to retrieve documents using an LLM.

This is a simple example where we only check if a chunk is relevant to the question.

As a subsequent evolution, the system could be enhanced to return chunks based on a relevance score.

See an example  [LLMRetriever.ipynb](LLMRetriever.ipynb)
